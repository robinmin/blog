    Flat vector illustration of a modern developer workspace in a 'getting
    started' theme. Center composition featuring a glowing hexagonal logo
    (representing Hexo) on a laptop screen with colorful terminal windows
    showing code commands floating around it. Include playful elements like a
    steaming coffee cup, potted plant, and abstract geometric shapes (hexagons,
    triangles) in vibrant colors: deep blue (#2C3E50), bright coral (#FF6B6B),
    mint green (#4ECDC4), and sunny yellow (#FFE66D). Clean, minimal style with
    smooth gradients and a light background. The hexagonal motif should be
    prominent but not overwhelming. Composition should be balanced and centered
    with clear focal point that remains recognizable when scaled down to
    thumbnail size. Style: contemporary tech illustration, approachable and
    friendly for beginners, 16:9 aspect ratio.
