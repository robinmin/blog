- 今日面试准备

  - Self introduction:

    - After graduated from school on 2000, I joined my first company as a software engineer. It is a Japanese company. We provided enterprise-class system solutions and technology consulting supports for travel agents, aviation companies and financial industries in Japan. That's the starting point for me to understand what the banking is and how the business can leverage the science and technologies in its daily work.
    - Actually, my second job was also as a tech leader for a Japan dedicated department in HP; and worked majorly for the relevant industries, suck as, telecommunication and banking and so on.
    - SCB
      In 2007, SCB got its RMB license in China as the first batch of foreign banks. Since that, the bank started to build its capabilities to ensure it can provide continuous banking service to the local individual consumers. - I was invided to join the bank as a CRM director by my friends to help the bank to establish a CRM solution. Through it, the bank hoped to build up a mechanism to ensure more smooth communications not only between the customers with the frontline sales but also the back office with the the frontline sales. - In that stage, the challenge for me is that the bank is lack of so many things. For example,: - seamless systems; - clean and accurate data sourcewitch we can reco with business and finance team; - a lot of relevant SOP; - We did:
      - Design and develop data warehouse from scratches, and consolated various datasources within the isolated systems;
      - Design data mart for particular articles by mgmt team's inquire;
      - Meanwhile, we also do the in-house development on the CRM system as the same time;
      - Build-up dedicated team for data analysis;
      - Based on that we provided:
        - Customer research, including customer profiling, customer behavior study, customer segmentation, Propensity Model and etc.;
        - Develop contact strategy and systimatic customer lifecycle management process;
        - Initiate a cross function working committee to design and execute marketing campaign. It involved several teams including marketing, product, sales and finance and so on.
      - We also helped:
        - Sales team on sales scorecard & incentive designing and optimization;
        - Sales team and Call center team on leads referral mechanism;
        - Marketing team on campaign monitoring and tracking process;
        - Meanwhile, we also built a systematic process to ensure the test & learn process to ensure the campaign quality control;
        - Product team on pipeline management;
        - Product team on reward point calculation and strategy designing;
        - Customer experience team on customer relationship evaluation (Identify potential complaint customer before the complaint coming);
      - Our hard and excellent works got highly recognition not only by the frontline sales and back office but also the country and group management team. My key team members and I received the retention bonus which initiated by our country head after the grand roull out of the first phase.
      - In 2012, we encountered a series of actions initiated by group to standardize the global CRM solution. I received the order to join the team to ensure the group CRM team will migrate existing modules in our local CRM system into group one to ensure the best practices will continuou once the system swiched. Unfortunately, by the end of the day, I provided all the relevant function specifics and screenshots. But the team cannot provide the same functionalities in the group CRM. The country head have to make decision to run both of the systems parallelly. That's the reason we can still see our CRM solution is runing very well in the bank today after most of my team member and I left the bank around 5 years.
      - Loyalty Program relevant experience in SCB
        - Debit card reward point calculation
        - Campaign designing - Including Customer targeting, estimation, monitoring and optimization.
          - X-sell - Upsell
        - Establish systematic programs:
          - On boarding process
          - MGM process
          - Reward point expiration alert (Reactive process)
    - Geex

      - I help the company to establish technology teams within the half year, including software developing team, test team, data management team, analytics team and risk team;
      - I left the company after 8 months as the funder cannot deliver their promise on option.

    - 40Fin

      - We build this company to provide clients with system solutions, data scientist decision services and business process optimization services.
      - We did:
        - Leads engine - an automatic leads quality classifier before any sales force involved;
        - Application scorecard optimization for an internet finance company;
        - Mobile CRM solution for a rural bank;
        - Differentiate pricing for a bank credit card center with MasterCard AA team;
        - We also have the other cases with AA:
          - BOC 5 step debit card utilization analysis;
          - CMBC case for differentiate pricing;
          - PingAn bank - customer segmentation optimization;
      - Why close the startup: - To large scale company, we are lack of company background endorsments for a startup. Althrough I have some personal resources to leverage at the very beginning, it can not be trated as long term solution. And that's the reason we partner with Mastercard AA to provide service to the clients. Obviously, we have to share the revenue with the partner due to this kind of cooperation. - To the SME, it is become harder and harder to get the requeriments as deal due to the economic challenge recently. - Meanwhile, staff cost becomes more and more heavy as the industry giant step into the same field.

    - PingAn Tech
      - We are an new established organization to help the subsidiaries to have the same customer experience and to avoid internal competition. The long term objective is to build up a customer centric culture instead of production centric or even worse.
      - We did:
        - help the bank to optimize their segmentation;
        - help Life insurance to optimize their sales incentive schema and customer segmentation;
      - Reason for leaving:
        - To tired.
        - To hard to fix existing issues: Extreme tight schedule and ridiculous result driven with invalid fundamental infrastructure support

  - career planning
    - An expert to leverage my experience and strength in the particular sectors with great business potential.
    - A leader can lead the juniors to help the company to fulfill its business ambition.
    - A leader who can mentor employees not only at the technical level but also at the business sense level.
  - Personal advantages:
    - With years’ experience on software developing, data science, business process optimization and enterprise management consulting simultaneously.
    - Working for several different industries, for example, travel agent, aviation, transportation, banking and etc. It can help me generate ideas from different angles for the daily work.
    - Open mind and extroverted personality
  - Questions:
    - What's your long term and short term vision of this job;
    - What's your expectation on me to fulfill this position;
    - What's your idea team size and scope;
